To create a new setlist, click \"New Set List.\" Name the setlist and add important information available to your team on the website, playback, and chart builder.</p>"+
    "<p>Add songs to your setlist. Search for the desired songs, select versions, and browse your library to add familiar ones. Once your setlist is ready, invite your team to view it by clicking the more menu and selecting \"Add People.\" Add specific members playing in the service.</p>"+
    "<p>Save your setlist to the cloud to make changes accessible to anyone who can access the setlist. Leave comments on changes for your team to stay updated.

Use the more menu and select \"Notify Team\" to attach a message and send an email to your team with a link back to the setlist in RehearsalMix.</p>"+
    "<p>For rehearsal, go to the tab on the left side and click \"RehearsalMix.\" Select the setlist and see the changes you made earlier. Expand the drop-down arrow for each song to access listening options. Listen along to the original master recording with the click and guide, and move on to the next song when ready.</p>"+
