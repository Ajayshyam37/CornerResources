As previously mentioned, content and user permissions apply when opening a setlist with purchased or rented tracks.\nTap the Setlists Icon in the top transport of Playback, to open the Setlists Main Menu. The currently opened setlist can be renamed, saved to the cloud and accessed from anywhere else in the ecosystem, and more from this menu.\n\nTo Open a previously saved setlist, tap Open Setlist and search for the setlist by name or sort upcoming and past setlists by service date.\nWhen tapping on the setlist you would like to load, you can see an overview of every setlist song, key and song length, as well as the saved arrangement being used in the setlist. Tap any download icons to download tracks onto your device without loading the setlist, or choose to load the setlist immediately and automatically start downloading every song.\nNote: Songs may already be downloaded onto your Playback device via another loaded setlist and will not show a download icon."

    "Description": "Transitions\nTransitions can be customized between songs in a setlist. There are few options to build seamless moments to fit your service.\n\nCue Next Song: When the first song comes to an end, the next song is selected but not started. When the Continue Pad toggle is enabled, the ambient pad will transition to the next song’s key and pad selection before the song is started.\n\nStay In Song: When the first song comes to an end, the song tile continues to be selected. When the Continue Pad toggle is enabled, the pad player will continue to play the first song’s ambient pad key and pad selection after the song ends.\n\nAutoLink: When the first song ends, the next song instantly starts playing.\n\nOverlap: Overlaps and starts the second song at full volume at a length equal to: Song 1's last section duration, song 2's first section duration, or 5 seconds -- whichever is least\n\nCrossfade: During the last 5 seconds of the first song, the second song fades in while the first song fades out.\n\nPro Tip: Combine transitions with custom start and end points to build specific transitions for your setlist."
