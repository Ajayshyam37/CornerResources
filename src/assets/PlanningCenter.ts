      <p>Welcome, fellow worship leaders! Join me on a journey to enhance your worship planning with Planning Center Services. While we're not physically going anywhere today, we're diving deep into the world of worship planning from the comfort of my home office. By the way, I painted my walls to create a cozy atmosphere.</p>\n\n\
      <p>As we're already into the second week of December, some of you might be procrastinating your Christmas service planning. Fear not, because now is the perfect time to step up your game with Planning Center Services, a versatile online app that can be a game-changer in organizing your worship services.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, remember to check out my recent video where I share my favorite Christmas songs for inspiration. And if you have any favorites, don't hesitate to share them in the comments below.</p>\n\n\
      <h3>The Power of Templates:</h3>\n\n\
      <p>Templates are your secret weapon for efficient planning. They allow you to create pre-made plans within Planning Center, which can be applied to multiple services. For instance, if you have similar Sunday morning services for a month, a template can save you time and effort by providing a foundation to build upon.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Creating a template is a breeze. Simply navigate to the service type you want to template, click the gear icon, and select 'Templates.' From there, you can craft your template, importing elements from existing plans, or start from scratch.</p>\n\n\
      <h3>Making Changes and Maximizing Templates:</h3>\n\n\
      <p>Need to make updates to an existing template? It's easy. Access the template, modify the necessary details, and save your changes. However, here's the catch: if you've already used the template to create plans, importing the template won't automatically update them. You'll need to manually import the updated template into each plan to apply the changes effectively.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Remember, the power of templates lies in their flexibility and potential to streamline your planning process. Whether it's organizing your connections team, adjusting needed positions, or fine-tuning service times, templates can be your go-to tool for creating seamless worship experiences.</p>\n\n\

      "Description": "<div>\n\
      <p>Welcome back, fellow musicians! Today, we're diving into the world of sharing song files with your team using Planning Center Services. So, let's get started on the songs page.</p>\n\n\
      <h3>Sharing Song Files:</h3>\n\n\
      <p>To attach files, begin by clicking the gear icon on the songs page. Make sure you've enabled integrations like SongSelect, PhraseCharts, or Rehearsal Mix – I've already got that sorted. Now, let's proceed.</p>\n\n\
      <p>To add a new song, simply head to the top right corner of the page and type in the song title. In my case, I'll use 'No Longer Slaves.' This brings up a list of popular songs, and I can even listen to a sample to ensure I've got the right one.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Once I've chosen the correct song, it automatically populates with useful information, including the original key. For my acoustic guitar player, I can easily add a capo and even include a separate chord chart. Tags can also be added to keep my database neat and organized.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Since I integrated with SongSelect, I can check a box to import lyrics or chord charts effortlessly. With the song now created, I can further enhance it in various ways.</p>\n\n\
      <h3>Adding Files to a Song:</h3>\n\n\
      <p>There are three ways to add files to a song:</p>\n\n\
      <ol>\n\
        <li>Clicking the plus sign provides options to upload files, link to external sites, attach files via integrations, or even add a YouTube link.</li>\n\
        <li>Quickly drag and drop files from your computer onto the corresponding key.</li>\n\
        <li>Utilize the lyrics and chords creator to craft your own transposable chord charts.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n\n\
      <p>If I want to add another key to this song, it's a breeze. I'll click 'Add Key,' and let's say I want to switch to A-flat. With one click, all my charts from B-flat are automatically transposed.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Now, let's integrate this song into a plan. From my plan, I'll click 'Add a Song' or simply press 'S' on my keyboard. I'll type in the song name, select a key, and voilà!</p>\n\n\
      <h3>Rehearsing and Sharing:</h3>\n\n\
      <p>My team members can now use the 'Rehearse' features either on the web or through the mobile app. They have the convenience of listening to audio via the media player or downloading a comprehensive songbook using 'Download All PDFs.'</p>\n\n\
      <p>If you found these tips helpful, give this video a thumbs up and consider subscribing to my channel for more valuable insights. Don't forget to hit that notification bell so you stay up to date with my upcoming content.</p>\n\n\

      <p>Let's dive into the world of team creation! Teams are the heart of your church, tailored to your unique needs and calling. Here's how to craft and curate teams and positions from the main plans page:</p>\n\n\
      <h3>Creating Teams and Positions:</h3>\n\n\
      <p>Begin by hovering over the settings icon and seamlessly transition to the teams option. Now, let's go ahead and add a team. For instance, let's create a 'Tech Team.' As the creator, you're automatically a team leader, and don't forget to add anyone overseeing scheduling as team leaders too.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Here's an intriguing twist – a rehearsal team. This team gains access to media players, songbooks, and song files, ideal for service preparation. Think about your tech team; sound directors, slide operators, they'll need this access, right?</p>\n\n\
      <p>Now, if your tech team serves across multiple service times, a split team might be in order. But since our tech team serves both our 9 AM and 10:30 AM services, we won't split it. Hit submit, and voilà – our tech team is born!</p>\n\n\
      <p>Let's up the ante by adding positions within our tech team. Click 'Add a Position.' For our tech team, we'll introduce the 'Tech Director' and 'Lights' positions. But oh, let's not forget the 'Computer' position! Positions cater to your unique needs, so feel free to adjust accordingly.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Now, let's bring the spotlight on assigning people to these positions. First up, the 'Tech Director.' Add a person – in this case, Ashley Johnson. The 'Tech Director' position now has its maestro! On to audio – for that, we'll add Tyrone. And for the 'Computer' wizardry, Jenna joins the fray. Positions are now adorned with capable individuals.</p>\n\n\
      <p>With positions assigned, we're returning to the plans page, mission accomplished! That's how you weave the tapestry of a team.</p>\n\n\
      <h3>Crafting Split Teams:</h3>\n\n\
      <p>The intrigue deepens with split teams! A different scenario awaits. Let's unravel the process from the main plans page. Once again, head over to settings, then teams, and behold – add team. In this instance, let's christen it 'First Impressions.'</p>\n\n\
      <p>Team leaders unite – you, as the creator, are bestowed with leadership, and any scheduling overseers should follow suit. Ah, rehearsal teams, a splendid tool, but for 'First Impressions,' not quite. We'll forgo the rehearsal team designation.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Hold onto your hats – a split team is on the horizon! Different service times, distinct volunteers – it's time to split. Our 'First Impressions' team is divvied into the 9 AM and 10:30 AM services, ensuring seamless operation. Bask in the glory of our split team creation!</p>\n\n\
      <p>Positions galore! Let's accentuate 'First Impressions' with 'Greeter,' 'Guest Services,' and 'Parking' positions. Positions that mirror your unique needs, fostering a welcoming atmosphere.</p>\n\n\
      <p>The final flourish – assigning remarkable individuals to these positions. For the 'Greeter' role, it's none other than yours truly. 'Guest Services' welcomes Brandenburg with open arms. And as for 'Parking,' Jacob Tilly takes the wheel.</p>\n\n\
      <p>You've woven a masterpiece of teams and positions, primed to serve your church community. Bravo!</p>\n\n\

      <p>Good morning, team leaders! Welcome to the first video in our series on how to make the most of Planning Center. In today's tutorial, we'll learn how to add new members to Planning Center and send them a welcome email, granting access to their schedules.</p>\n\n\
      <h3>Adding New Members and Sending Welcome Emails:</h3>\n\n\
      <p>Begin by logging into Planning Center at <a href='https://planningcenteronline.com'>planningcenteronline.com</a>. As registered users, you'll be directed to the familiar interface. Let's dive right in! Click on the 'People' tab at the top to reveal your list of members. On the side, you'll find the 'Add a New Person' option.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Clicking 'Add a New Person,' you can type in the person's name and hit 'Create a New Person.' Fill in their first and last name, and their email address. This email will be used for their welcome email, which we'll explore shortly. You have the choice to send a welcome email, which grants permissions, including the ability to view schedules.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Submitting the information takes you to their profile page, where you'll find three tabs. For now, let's focus on the 'Preferences and Teams' tab. By clicking 'Add,' you can assign them to a specific team. For instance, let's add 'John Doe' to the 'Greeters' team.</p>\n\n\
      <p>If you encounter any issues with the team not appearing after adding, a simple page refresh (F5) will do the trick. Once you refresh, you'll see the 'Greeters' team assigned to 'John Doe.' You can manage their preferences within this tab, including the times they're available to serve.</p>\n\n\
      <p>Under the 'Communication' tab, members can opt into receiving text messages for alerts. Provide their phone number and other details to ensure smooth communication. The 'Details' tab allows changes in permissions, attachment of files, and more. You can also add notes, which I recommend specifying the ministry name and any relevant details to aid scheduling.</p>\n\n\
      <p>And there you have it! That concludes our tutorial. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at the church (232-3524) or via email at travis@flagchurch.com. Have a fantastic day!</p>\n\n\
